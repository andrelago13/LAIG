# LAIG

Set of 3 projects developed for the "Laboratory of Applications And Graphic Interfaces" (LAIG) course of the Integrated Master's in Informatics and Computer Engineering of the Faculty Of Engineering of the University of Porto.

The first project is a XML Parser that allows reading 3d scenes from a XML file with a specific syntax. After reading, the parser initializes the 3d objects to create the scene as specified.

The second project extends the XML syntax used, allowing the creation of animations, curve sufaces and modified shaders.

The third and last project was the main project of the course. The objective was to develop a graphical interface for a [Prolog game we developed earlier in another course](https://github.com/gtugablue/PLOG-MOD-X). Some of the functionalities implemented are:
- 1P, 2P or BOT vs. BOT modes
- Undo plays
- Game movie
- Camera position switching (not free roam, rather a set of pre-defined positions)
- Scenario changing
- Multiple animations both for plays and camera position changing
